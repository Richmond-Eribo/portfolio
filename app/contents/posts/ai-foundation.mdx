Every wave of technology starts with a foundation, and the story of AI is no
different. The Industrial Revolution mechanized labor, converting human muscle
into machine power and reshaping economies. The digital revolution then
automated information, enabling software to scale decisions across industries.
Today, the AI era is building on both, shifting from automation to intelligence
and making decision-making systems the core infrastructure of modern
organizations.

The conceptual roots go back to Alan Turing’s idea of a universal machine—a
simple set of rules that can simulate any computation. The Turing machine wasn’t
a product, it was a foundation: a proof that computation could be generalized.
That idea became the bedrock of computer science, and it set the stage for a
later question: if computation is general, can intelligence be engineered?

In 1956, John McCarthy organized the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on
Artificial Intelligence. The Dartmouth proposal didn’t just coin the term “AI”;
it framed intelligence as something that could be described, represented, and
built. That moment is often treated as AI’s birth, but it was more than a
milestone—it was a declaration that intelligence could be a system, not a
mystery.

Fast forward to today and the transformer architecture sits at the center of
modern AI. Transformers made it possible to scale learning across language,
vision, and multimodal tasks by focusing on attention and context. In many ways,
transformers are the practical bridge between Turing’s abstraction and
McCarthy’s ambition. They turn computation into learning, and learning into
general-purpose capabilities that can be reused across products.

This is why I call this moment “AI Foundations.” It’s not only about bigger
models. It’s about building the data, tooling, evaluation, and product
structures that let intelligence be reliable and repeatable. Just as the
Industrial Revolution required power grids and factories, the AI revolution
needs model infrastructure, feedback loops, and trust mechanisms.

Industry 4.0 connected machines to data. AI Foundations connect data to
decisions. The leap is subtle but massive: systems don’t just report the world,
they now interpret it, predict it, and assist in shaping it. That is the real
move from Industry 4.0 to AI Foundations.
